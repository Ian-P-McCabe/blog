# Overview

In [Part 1](https://ian-p-mccabe.github.io/shirt-color-space/) and [Part 2](https://ian-p-mccabe.github.io/shirt-color-space/part_2/) we explored the issues facing the Stonewall Dodgeball league when selecting shirt colors. In Part 1 we found the best way to add additional colors to the league and in Part 2 we explored heuristics for finding the best subset of colors for the league so no two colors are too similar. 

Part 3 will expand on part 2, introducing proper optimization methods for color selection. We will begin by showing how to select the best (most diverse) colors for the league and then expand on this by taking into account team preference.

I have decided to keep all code cells hidden for this writeup, but feel free to expand any of the
codeblocks on this page (denoted by "> Code"). All the source code can be found on my GitHub. 


```{python}
import numpy
import pandas as pd
from colormath import color_objects, color_diff
import math

# This exists to resolve an issue with the colormath library 
def patch_asscalar(a):
    return a.item()
setattr(numpy, "asscalar", patch_asscalar)

color_df = pd.read_csv("../../data/all_colors.csv")
```

# Refresher

## There are a lot of colors!

The dodgeball league provides 103 unique shirt colors to pick from. 

Eagle eyed readers will see that there are 110 colors lsited below, however I have removed a few duplicate colors from the pool.

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
lab_string = list(color_df["L*a*b Value"])
lab_strings = [color_string.split(", ") for color_string in lab_string]

lab_floats = [[float(x) for x in row] for row in lab_strings]

lab_colors = [color_objects.LabColor(lab_l=lab_color[0], lab_a=lab_color[1], lab_b=lab_color[2]) for lab_color in lab_floats]
```

## Obtaining LAB Values

In order to accurately determine color difference, we will need to obtain the LAB values for each possible shirt color. 
The LAB color system is best for this analysis because it accurately represents how humans see and differentiate color. 

![How I got LAB Color Info](./assets/ColorInfoProcess.png)

LAB color information for most colors can be obtained from the PMS (Pantone Matching System) code beneath the swatch on the color palette. 
Pantone provides LAB (and other color) information for each color with a PMS code. (For colors without a PMS code, I approximated a LAB value from the display RGB value)

## Color Difference

Once we have our LAB values, we can easily compute color difference.

For color difference calculations, will use the [CIEDE2000 distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference#CIEDE2000). Color difference is returned as a ∆E value. 


### Delta E Values and Color-Difference Perceptibility

| Delta E (ΔE) | Perceptibility | Description |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| < 1 | Imperceptible | Colors appear identical to most observers |
| 1–2 | Very Slight | Only experts notice the difference |
| 2–10 | Noticeable | Average person notices on close inspection |
| 10–20 | Obvious | Clearly different colors |
| > 20 | Very Distinct | Colors are dramatically different |

For **shirt color selection**, we will use:

- **ΔE < 5**: Risk of confusion, too similar
- **ΔE 5–10**: Acceptable if team choices are prioritized over maximum distinctness
- **ΔE > 10**: Safe choice, easily distinguishable in all conditions
- **∆E > 20**: Ideal choice, very distinct colors 

### Examples

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6}

---
These two colors are **2** units apart:
```{python}
#|output: true
from dodgeball_colors_3 import display_color_swatches
display_color_swatches(hex_colors=[color_df.iloc[8]['Hex'], color_df.iloc[55]['Hex']])
```
---


These two colors are **10** units apart:
```{python}
#|output: true
display_color_swatches([color_df.iloc[0]['Hex'], color_df.iloc[46]['Hex']])
```
---

These two colors are **20** units apart:
```{python}
#|output: true
display_color_swatches([color_df.iloc[1]['Hex'], color_df.iloc[68]['Hex']])
```
---

:::

::: {.g-col-6}

---

These two colors are **30** units apart:

```{python}
#| output: true
display_color_swatches([color_df.iloc[0]['Hex'], color_df.iloc[1]['Hex']])
```
---

And these two colors are **80** units apart:
```{python}
#| output: true
display_color_swatches([color_df.iloc[6]['Hex'], color_df.iloc[46]['Hex']])
```

# Finding the best colors

Now that we have our colors in a format we can properly analyze, we can return to answer our central question:

**What is the best set of shirt colors for the dodgeball league?**

In part 2 we covered why this isn't super easy to compute:

- Analyzing the best combinations of 16 colors yeilds **2,245,547,413,628,550,570** possible combinations! (2 quintillion)
- Analyzing the best combinations of 24 colors, we must score **178,409,928,551,259,450,861,900** possible combinations! (178 sextillion)

I framed the problem as a a subset of the Maximum Diversity Problem - how can we select the subset of colors that are most distant from each other on average?

In Part 2 we used some heuristics to try an approximate the subset of colors with the highest average distance, these included random searches, greedy algorithms, and generating a convex hull of the LAB color space. 

While these are fun approximations (especially the convex hull visual), they pale in comparison to the power of proper optimization methods. 

We will use Google's **Operations Research Tools Constraint Programming - SAT Solver** to systematically explore solutions to our color diversity problem. 

The CP-SAT solver is flexible enough to enable us to explore the original **maximum pairwise distance** approach as well as other measures such as **maximum minimum distance**.

```{python}
#| output: false
from dodgeball_colors_3 import build_distance_matrix
  
distance_matrix = build_distance_matrix(lab_colors)

num_colors = 103
num_colors_to_select = 16
```
