    "text": "In Part 1 and Part 2 we explored the issues facing the Stonewall Dodgeball league when selecting shirt colors. In Part 1 we found the best way to add additional colors to the league and in Part 2 we explored heuristics for finding the best subset of colors for the league so no two colors are too similar.\nPart 3 will expand on part 2, introducing proper optimization methods for color selection. We will begin by showing how to select the best (most diverse) colors for the league and then expand on this by taking into account team preference.\nI have decided to keep all code cells hidden for this writeup, but feel free to expand any of the codeblocks on this page (denoted by “&gt; Code”). All the source code can be found on my GitHub.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom colormath import color_objects, color_diff\nimport math\n\n# This exists to resolve an issue with the colormath library \ndef patch_asscalar(a):\n    return a.item()\nsetattr(numpy, \"asscalar\", patch_asscalar)\n\ncolor_df = pd.read_csv(\"../../data/all_colors.csv\")"

    "text": "Obtaining LAB Values\nIn order to accurately determine color difference, we will need to obtain the LAB values for each possible shirt color. The LAB color system is best for this analysis because it accurately represents how humans see and differentiate color.\n\n\n\nHow I got LAB Color Info\n\n\nLAB color information for most colors can be obtained from the PMS (Pantone Matching System) code beneath the swatch on the color palette. Pantone provides LAB (and other color) information for each color with a PMS code. (For colors without a PMS code, I approximated a LAB value from the display RGB value)"
